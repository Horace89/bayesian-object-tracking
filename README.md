# Tracking Objects From Sensor Data


## Introduction

The aim of this project is to track objects, even through occlusion, given sensor data, such as from a laser scan.

I am just starting this project, and am planning to use synthetic data for the first version of this project.


## Dependencies

  - torchfile
  - numpy
  - pillow
  - matplotlib

You can install all these dependencies with pip, as

  ```
    pip install torchfile numpy pillow matplotlib
  ```
